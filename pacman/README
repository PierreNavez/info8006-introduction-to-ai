## How to launch the game (Part 1/3)

Launches a game with a random agent in default map mediumClassic:
```bash
python run.py
```

Launches a game with your Pacman agent class, named PMAgent located in `youragentmodule.py`, and with the maze originalClassic (see layout folder).
```bash
python run.py --layout originalClassic --agentfile youragentmodule.py
```

Same configuration as above but without the possibility of computation at game initialization.
```bash
python run.py --layout mediumClassic --agentfile youragentmodule.py --onlyonline
```


See the help section of the command line for more information about the parameters.

## Scoring

The score function is computed as follows:

`score = -#time steps + 10*#number of food dots eaten + (500 when finished)`
